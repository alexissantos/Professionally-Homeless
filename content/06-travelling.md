# Chapter 6: Travelling

I know I’m going to have to pay two sets of insurance every year. Rather than having a nasty surprise every October and needing to scramble around for money, I put that cash away every month. As soon as my premium is due, I have the money ready to pay it - and I get to keep the interest I’ve accrued from it sitting in my savings account for 12 months. Think of it like paying a direct debit to yourself. Why not just pay insurance in monthly instalments like you do with home insurance or car insurance right now? Because lots of travel insurance companies either don’t offer monthly instalments at all, or the price is dramatically higher if you choose to pay monthly instead of yearly. 

Visas and legal paperwork are regularly (but not always) required for me to enter various countries. On average I’ll need a visa once every 3 months, and it costs me on average between £20 ($31) and £80 ($124). I know that these costs will definitely occur, I just don’t know when.

A visa is a legal document issued by a country’s government which gives non-citizens permission to enter take up temporary residence in that country. Visas come with conditions and complications, and every country is different. The first thing you should research before thinking about travelling to any country is what the visa requirements are. Whether or not you need a visa depends on your citizenship, and where you’re going.  Generally speaking if you’re from North America or Europe you can go to most countries for 28 days or less with no visa. Unfortunately, the type of travel we’re talking about in this book is pretty much always longer than 28 days… so the most common visa I have to apply for is the short-stay visa. 

OSX Dashboard widgets

There are a couple of really handy OSX Dashboard widgets which I use constantly while travelling and make my life generally much more pleasurable.

TimeScroller

This has got to be my number one recommendation for working remotely while travelling. It’s pretty easy to figure out what time it is in various places right now using multiple clock widgets, Google, or anything else with multiple timezones. But when your client requests a meeting at 2pm EST on Monday, what time is that going to be for you? To avoid laborious finger-counting and inevitable mistakes, TimeScroller allows you to set up as many locations as you like, and then scroll through time simultaneously on all of them. It’s incredibly simple, and incredibly useful. In the example above I could simply scroll the widget to 2pm on Monday in New York, then scan down the list for my current location and make a note of what time it’ll be for me.

(TimeScroller tip: Arrange your list of places in order of timezone for easy scanning. For example: San Francisco at the top (UTC −7), London in the middle (UTC +0), Sydney at the bottom (UTC +10). It’ll give you an extra quick visual cue of who’s behind/ahead of your current timezone.)

Currency Converter

This widget does almost the same thing as TimeScroller, but with money. Rather than scrolling through a list of times and seeing their equivalents in different timezones, I can enter a value in any currency of my choice - then see the equivalent value in all of the other currencies in the list. The exchange rates update automatically whenever you’re online, and being able to see multiple currencies concurrently saves a great deal of time.

iStat Pro

Mentioned previously, iStat Pro is a great widget which is effectively a miniature Activity Monitor. It keeps an eye on your computer temperatures, but it also tells you the state of your battery’s health, which processes are using the most CPU power, and how much storage is used/available on all your connected hard drives.

Countdown X

This is a silly little thing, really, but I like it. I always have a countdown running to my next departure date. On the one hand it reminds me what I’ve got to look forward to, and on the other hand it reminds me that I have limited time left to appreciate where I am right now.

Tripit

Listening to music while travelling - fuck people who say not to, do it.

## Travel Hacks

After a certain number of years of travelling, you figure out an incredibly high number of tiny optimisations to make your life easier while travelling. Alone, each one is relatively inconsequential, but combined, they are the proverbial keys to the kingdom of happy travels. This is a guide to the things that I've picked up in the last 20 or so years, and several hundred trips of varying length.

### Flying

The flying experience is one that only seems exciting up until the point that you actually do it. The second you arrive at the airport, the fairy tale evaporates and you resolve yourself to the next 24 hours of being herded around like livestock and/or treated like a criminal at every possible opportunity.

### Security

Much like the joke in the movie [Up in the Air (2009)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1193138/), the key to a fast trip through security is to understand that racial profiling (both in preferential as well as discriminatory ways) is a real thing. It's not right or fair, but it is prevalent, especially in airports. 

Also, whenever you see some of those plastic baggies for liquids lying around, always grab a few spares. In some airports they're free but in many you have to pay for them, so it's always handy to have a couple tucked away in your washbag (you know, where you keep your liquids).

### Plane Food

There's are two simple tricks to airline food which every seasoned traveller knows. First - when given the option, you always choose the cuisine native to the home country of the airline which you're flying. Second, when the option involves [anything in the entire fucking world] or omelette, you never - ever - ever take the omelette.

### Selecting a Row

Where you sit in relation to the length of the plane can frequently make just as big of a difference to your happiness as where you sit in relation to the width of the plane.

Business class at the front. Why? Because they're the first to get on, and the first to get off. The frequent traveller desires speed, to shorten the generally hellish process of air travel by the largest margin possible. The best seat (in any class) is always as far toward the front of the plane as possible, so you're the first one to get off at the other end. This may seem pedantic, but being at the back triggers a domino-effect of delays which quickly add up. Last off the plane means last into the terminal, which means last into the immigration queue, which means last to the baggage carousel, which means last through the security checkpoint on the way out of the airport. If you're the first off the plane (with no checked baggage) it's occasionally possible to be out of the airport in less than 10 minutes.

There's one exception to this rule: When buses are involved. When buses from the aiport terminal are involved, the entire process is dramatically reversed. The last one off the plane is the last one on the bus, and the last one onto the bus is the first one off the bus and into the terminal. You get extra OCD points if you manage to plan your seat selection with a degree of accuracy which takes into account the terminal-to-aircraft connection of your particular airline and destination.

### Selecting a Seat

Amateur travellers take the window seat because they want to see clouds and shit. Semi-experienced travellers take the isle seat because they think it's cooler and has more legroom. Experienced travellers take the window seat because they know the only thing more annoying than the food cart crashing into your knees every 30 minutes is the idiot beside you constantly getting up to vanquish the stirrings in his uncontrollable bladder. Experienced travellers pee once before boarding and use the window as a headrest for sleeping.

Nobody ever wants the middle seat.

Peace and quiet is the aim of the game. Super-experienced travellers pick out their top 3 seats in advance with [SeatGuru](http://www.seatguru.com/) and request (or select) them during check-in.

# Chapter 6: Travelling

I know I’m going to have to pay two sets of insurance every year. Rather than having a nasty surprise every October and needing to scramble around for money, I put that cash away every month. As soon as my premium is due, I have the money ready to pay it - and I get to keep the interest I’ve accrued from it sitting in my savings account for 12 months. Think of it like paying a direct debit to yourself. Why not just pay insurance in monthly instalments like you do with home insurance or car insurance right now? Because lots of travel insurance companies either don’t offer monthly instalments at all, or the price is dramatically higher if you choose to pay monthly instead of yearly. 

Visas and legal paperwork are regularly (but not always) required for me to enter various countries. On average I’ll need a visa once every 3 months, and it costs me on average between £20 ($31) and £80 ($124). I know that these costs will definitely occur, I just don’t know when.

A visa is a legal document issued by a country’s government which gives non-citizens permission to enter take up temporary residence in that country. Visas come with conditions and complications, and every country is different. The first thing you should research before thinking about travelling to any country is what the visa requirements are. Whether or not you need a visa depends on your citizenship, and where you’re going.  Generally speaking if you’re from North America or Europe you can go to most countries for 28 days or less with no visa. Unfortunately, the type of travel we’re talking about in this book is pretty much always longer than 28 days… so the most common visa I have to apply for is the short-stay visa. 

OSX Dashboard widgets

There are a couple of really handy OSX Dashboard widgets which I use constantly while travelling and make my life generally much more pleasurable.

TimeScroller

This has got to be my number one recommendation for working remotely while travelling. It’s pretty easy to figure out what time it is in various places right now using multiple clock widgets, Google, or anything else with multiple timezones. But when your client requests a meeting at 2pm EST on Monday, what time is that going to be for you? To avoid laborious finger-counting and inevitable mistakes, TimeScroller allows you to set up as many locations as you like, and then scroll through time simultaneously on all of them. It’s incredibly simple, and incredibly useful. In the example above I could simply scroll the widget to 2pm on Monday in New York, then scan down the list for my current location and make a note of what time it’ll be for me.

(TimeScroller tip: Arrange your list of places in order of timezone for easy scanning. For example: San Francisco at the top (UTC −7), London in the middle (UTC +0), Sydney at the bottom (UTC +10). It’ll give you an extra quick visual cue of who’s behind/ahead of your current timezone.)

Currency Converter

This widget does almost the same thing as TimeScroller, but with money. Rather than scrolling through a list of times and seeing their equivalents in different timezones, I can enter a value in any currency of my choice - then see the equivalent value in all of the other currencies in the list. The exchange rates update automatically whenever you’re online, and being able to see multiple currencies concurrently saves a great deal of time.

iStat Pro

Mentioned previously, iStat Pro is a great widget which is effectively a miniature Activity Monitor. It keeps an eye on your computer temperatures, but it also tells you the state of your battery’s health, which processes are using the most CPU power, and how much storage is used/available on all your connected hard drives.

Countdown X

This is a silly little thing, really, but I like it. I always have a countdown running to my next departure date. On the one hand it reminds me what I’ve got to look forward to, and on the other hand it reminds me that I have limited time left to appreciate where I am right now.

Tripit

Listning to music while travelling - fuck people who say not to, do it.

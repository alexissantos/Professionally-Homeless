# Chapter 2: Planning

So how does this whole thing work? Before considering embarking from your comfortable home and lifestyle into a tumultuous life of planes and trains, you need to figure out how to make the transition from one to the other. This is actually the hardest part of the entire process.

We’ll start with how to plan financially, seeing as this is the part that people generally have the most questions and concerns about.

## What it Costs to Travel The World Indefinitely

The way it’s possible to travel full time is quite straightforward. If you sell everything you own, get rid of all your bills by not living anywhere, and keep making the same amount of money… you actually end up with a fairly high level of disposable income with which to budget each month. Before I left the UK I was living in Lincoln, which is a remarkably cheap area to live in compared to the South, but I was still paying roughly £1,800 ($2,800) every month in rent and bills. I didn’t live extravagantly by any means. Add up all your rent, council tax, utilities, broadband, and all the things you pay every month - you’ll probably be surprised by what a big number it all adds up to.

### The Basics

Generally speaking the average long-haul one-way plane ticket costs around £400 ($630), a decent short-term apartment costs an average of £250 ($400) a month. You can spend maybe another £250 ($400) per month on food and drink. With an average of 1 long-haul flight once every 2 months, this brings monthly costs to a total of about £700 ($1,115).

Even for the most modest of freelancers, this is pretty manageable.

That being said, let's be very clear about something: It’s incredibly easy to find flights which cost twice the price and accommodation which costs 12 times as much. There’s a degree of required common-sense involved here. If your idea of travel is to take a direct flight to the Maldives and stay in a 5 star resort for a month, you can throw this budget out the window. 

The biggest thing you have to eject immediately from your brain is that this is not a holiday. Do not think of it like a holiday, do not approach it like a holiday. You aren't on holiday.

### The Contingency

Now, as well as planning for your monthly outgoings for travel, accommodation and food - you also need to put some money away every month. This is not optional. If you don’t have a savings account which you are putting money into every month - you will inevitably find yourself puking your guts out somewhere in Thailand with no way of flying home and no laptop because you left it in the back of a TucTuc. At this point you are, as they say, “fucked”.

Every month I put £200 ($310) in a savings account to cover my ass. It breaks down like this:

Equipment Insurance for Cameras/Laptop - £20 ($31)
Worldwide Travel Insurance - £30 ($46)
Visas/Legal Paperwork - £50 ($78)
Emergency Fund - £80 ($124)
Christmas - £20 ($31)

I know that I’m going to have to pay for all of these things at various points throughout the year. Rather than being surprised by them when they suddenly pop up and need to be paid for, I save the money up and have it ready. You might think that Christmas is a weird one to save up for when travelling the world alone - but I promise you that you’re going to want a little extra money in December no matter where you are or who you’re with. The most important one is the emergency fund. This is cold hard cash that you’re putting away with zero intention or plans for spending. Under no circumstance should you ever dip into it. We’ll cover each one of these things in more detail in the “Gear” chapter later on.

### The Luxuries

The costs so far have been pretty standard, but if I’m going to all the effort of seeing different countries dotted all over the globe then I want to do some things while I’m there. I really value learning new things, so I budget roughly £200 ($310) a month for activities - which usually involves learning a new skill or hobby. Something else I’ve found is that since travelling and not owning very much stuff, I suddenly value the few things I have much more. The biggest examples of this are music, and clothes. I budget roughly another £100 ($160) per month for buying new music and replacing clothes.

What costs you put in this category are entirely up to you and your interests. Just make sure you plan for them, even if you’re not sure what they are yet. Everyone has things which they want to spend money on for their own happiness, the nice thing that I’ve found about travelling is that because my costs are so much lower than living in the UK - I actually have more money left over each month to budget for this.

### Totalling it all up

In total, I budget for roughly £1,200 ($1,880) per month, for absolutely everything. This is absolutely not the cheapest way to do it. I like to stay in nice apartments, and I like to spend money in the luxuries category because that’s what I get the most enjoyment from. I could carry on travelling and living (a little more modestly) for about £700 a month. Talking about how much everything costs is difficult, because everyone has different levels of income (what seems cheap to me may seem expensive to you), and different expectations (an apartment that I see as “lovely” you might think of as “dire”). 

Start with the basics, and then try writing down a list of the things that are most important to you and what you can afford to pay for them each month. Everyone will construct their budget differently. I’ll cover more details of cost throughout the book, there are so many options when it comes to flights and accommodation and gear that it makes more sense to put that information in their respective chapters. Think of this section simply as a starting point to give you a general idea of how it all fits together.

## Leaving Your House & Getting Rid of All Your Shit

This is the big one - this takes the most time, and is the hardest one for most people to get past. Why do you need to sell your shit? Because the only way this lifestyle is affordable is if you don’t have the overheads of a house and everything in it weighing you down. 

Chances are that you’ve accumulated a lot of stuff over the years, and chances are that you don’t remotely need or care about most of it. Being able to carry everything you own in a carry-on sized bag is an extremely liberating experience which you can’t remotely appreciate simply by reading it. You will find, as you research blogs and other publications on this subject - just how often people talk about how fantastic it is to “not own anything” - and you’ll think “yeah ok I get it” every time. But you don't. And you won't. Not yet.

I expected a lot of things when I started traveling, and most of them ended up being accurate. One thing which I didn’t expect, or plan for in any capacity, was just how drastically my general outlook on the world would change following the removal of material possessions. Prior to departure I’d absorbed countless articles discussing the sense of freedom from giving up all one owns. But I’ve never really been that attached to “stuff” – and I had no reservations about giving up mine – so I didn’t really see it as a big deal. The shift in perspective doesn’t really have much to do with the things you own owning you, as such (it would be very easy to go over the hippy edge with this). It’s actually more of a state of mind. Whilst living a “normal” life, even as a relatively non-materialistic person, I was always thinking about the next “thing” to buy, or pay for, or do. I had absolutely no appreciation for how much time my mind spent locked into this rut of: earn money, buy something, do cool things with it, earn a bit more money, buy another thing.

Now that’s all gone. Not only do I have no “stuff” – but I can’t buy any new stuff at all unless I’m both able and willing to carry it on my back inside my hand-luggage-sized backpack around the world. Which is an extended way of saying: there’s nothing I want or need to buy, and even if I did – I couldn’t.

There’s a frustratingly large gap in my head where a bunch of things which I used to care about once resided. It really changes your perspective on life in quite a dramatic way - but definitely for the better.

Why sell stuff instead of put it in storage? Cause storage costs money, and selling stuff makes money. You need money, not debt to a room full of stuff you never use. Right now, I have two cardboard boxes stored in my friend Hannah’s loft (she’s very nice and doesn’t charge me). It’s just sentimental stuff really, nothing particularly special. Everything else is gone, and it made me a lot of cash that really helped getting everything set up for travelling. Here are some things I learned during the process:

### Start Selling Early

Selling stuff takes time, it really does. Start as soon as possible. You’ll be much more likely to get the amount you want for high-priced items like computers and furniture if you have them available for sale for a while rather than getting to a point where they just “MUST BE GONE BY FRIDAY”. I started getting rid of my stuff 3 months in advance, and it wasn’t really enough. I had to give away a £300 dining room set and throw away a lot more things than anticipated.

#### Where to Sell Stuff

If you’re tech-savvy enough to be reading this book, then you should know what eBay is. Go use it. Other than eBay, family and friends in the area are good for offering things like furniture and small items to. I distributed things like camera gear, office equipment and bedside tables and TVs amongst all my friends in Lincoln. When possible, this is great because it saves you time, headaches, ebay fees, shipping costs, and effort. In return I gave them all really good prices on stuff that was in excellent condition.

With certain niche items, you may be better off avoiding eBay and going straight to where you know people in that niche hang out. For example, I had a lot of expensive web design books in my house. I knew they’d make almost nothing on eBay - I also knew that most (read: all) web designers hang out all day on Twitter. So I grouped the books (and a few other appropriate designer things, like a graphics tablet) into about 10 lots of stuff, took photos of it, and then conducted a Twitter auction. This quite simply involved me Tweeting a photo of the stuff that was for sale and saying “Highest bid via Twitter by [time] wins” - it worked a treat. I made about £300 ($470) from selling all my old books, when I expected to get less than a third of that.

### Start Ejecting Early

You’re going to sell a lot of stuff. You’re also going to throw away a lot of stuff. The latter will astound you. One of the biggest (and easily avoidable) hurdles which I encountered when moving out of my house was the fact that the local tip (junk yard) had very bizarre seasonal opening hours which happened to change the day before I was due to do all of my unloading. To cut a long story short, this culminated in driving around town with my friend Amy and looking for empty bins to tip my stuff into one bag/box at a time. It was slow, tiring, and slightly (very) illegal. Not recommended. 

## Make a Schedule

It doesn’t have to be super detailed - but make a schedule of when you plan to sell stuff by, and schedule completely clearing out one room each weekend. It’s much more manageable to tackle one room at a time than to try and do your entire house in one go. Throw a list of to-do’s on your calendar and map out how you’re going to clear all your clutter by the time your move-out date roles around. 

### Be Ruthless

Really think long and hard whenever you have select an item to save or put in storage. How much is it worth now? How much will it be worth a year from now? Are you likely to want it a year from now? Will it have been replaced by a newer model? Would you be able to sell it now and buy a new one in a year for less? If in doubt, get rid of it. 

### Move Out a Month Early

If possible, get out of your house a month early. Why? Because that’s a month of rent and bills that you don’t have to pay, and you can use the time to travel around your country visiting friends who, if you’re lucky, will be kind enough to let you stay with them for free. This ticks three big boxes: First, you get to see everyone before leaving for a long time. Second, you have an entire month’s worth of income with almost no outgoings. Lastly, this gives you the opportunity to live out of your backpack as a test for a full month. If you need to make any additions or subtractions to your travel gear (and you will), you still have time to do it before you actually leave.

### Wind Up Your Bills Early

Everyone accumulates a proverbial fuck-ton of financial commitments from living somewhere. Electricity, water, waste water, gas, broadband, TV, cable TV, council tax, phone, mobile phone, home insurance, car insurance, club memberships… the list goes on. Plan on lots of them having cancellation fees or large final bills. Utilities and mobile/broadband contracts in particular. I had to pay about £150 ($234) to buy out of my broadband contract and £250 ($390) to buy out of my mobile phone contract. These things aren’t fun - but it’s amazing to be free of them once they’re all paid up. The best thing you can do is call them *early* (months in advance) to find out what their cancellation policies are. Make a list of when you need to cancel by. For many of them it will be a full month prior to the date which you intend to move out by.

## Further Reading

The trend with all of these tips is to start early. It takes time and effort to organise all of this and leaving it to the last minute makes everything more difficult and less profitable. If done right, you’ll be amazed how much money you’ll free up. Simon Fairburn and Erin McNeany are a couple who sold everything to travel the world indefinitely in 2008. I got lots of useful information from their blog, The Never Ending Voyage, before I departed. They’ve got a great 3 part series on how to sell all your stuff which describes, in detail, the methods they used to get rid of all their possessions and made £3,674 ($5,746) prior to departing on their journey - http://bit.ly/MsDLLH

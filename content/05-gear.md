# Chapter 5: Gear

What do you need with you to travel the world and have a fully functional mobile office? Surprisingly little. It’s worth noting before we get started that everyone has different requirements. It’s more important to put together a set of gear based on your own needs than exactly matching a packing list. When I started out I went a bit overboard with this, picking up every cool travel gadget I could find based on backpacker packing lists and, to cut a long story short, I ended up resembling a slightly chubby Crocodile Dundee. It wasn’t good. 

I’m going to tell you what’s in my bag. Rather than just giving you a list and saying “buy this” - I’ll tell you why each item is there, what I started out with and then changed later, and things which I started out with and then got rid of later.

One other thing to note up front, is that you should get all of your other affairs in order before you start buying gear. It’s easy and extremely fun to start buying all this stuff, but it’s also a distraction. I’d recommend booking your flights, giving notice on your house to move out, and selling as much of your other stuff as possible before you start buying any new gear. You don’t really need to start buying equipment until a month before you leave, with a few exceptions which we’ll go into I a moment.

## Packing Light

There’s an obsession among backpackers and frequent travellers about packing light. You will find many people, much smarter than I am, who manage to travel the world with a bag the size of a small rabbit, 2 tshirts, and a toothpick. It’s a big movement, and you’ll find entire sites dedicated to the beauty of packing lists and techniques. Packing light, however, is aimed very much at backpackers (who don’t work) and businessmen (who go on short trips). For the “digital nomad” - packing light isn’t actually such a major requirement. 

Here’s the golden rule for packing: The more time you spend on the road, the less you can take with you.

The backpacking lifestyle generally involves a different hostel every few days, and for those people packing light doesn’t just make sense - it’s pretty much the only way to survive. The nomadic lifestyle, on the other hand, involves a new place every couple of months and generally when travelling it’s from apartment to airport to apartment. In this case, you have to transport your luggage so infrequently that it really doesn’t matter so much.

If you plan to take a chicken bus across Thailand before riding a motorbike through the Cambodia for a week, you’re going to need to pack very light. If you plan to go to a place and explore that area using your apartment as a base - there’s a lot more flexibility. 

I do a combination of both. Everything I need to live and work fits into a single carry-on-sized backpack, but I also take a very large, heavy, awkward bag full of kiteboarding equipment with me. For me, this set-up is ideal, because it’s flexible. When I’m travelling to kiteboarding destinations, I can deal with lugging a big heavy kite bag with me every couple of months. When I’m travelling for speaking engagements or press trips, I can get by with only my backpack. I either put my kite bag in storage, or ship it back to the UK temporarily using a service like http://lugless.com.

So I have two bags: my core kit, which I try to keep as light as possible, and my leisure kit, which I don’t.

## The Basics

First we’ll have a look at the basics. These are the things that keep you alive from day-to-day and allow you to exist out of a backpack. Nothing fancy, just enough to get you by. Again, there are no affiliate links here, just straight-up info on what I use.

### The Bag

This is arguably the most important piece of gear, full-stop, because it’s responsible for holding all of your other gear and keeping it safe while you travel - so we’re going to go into some detail. You really need to like your bag, because you guys are going to be spending a great deal of time together. The last thing you want is to find yourself in the middle of a jungle with two broken zips and a set of roller-wheels clogged with monkey shit. Spend both time and money here getting what’s right for you.

When it comes to bags there are a lot of options, so let’s go through some of the most common sources of debate:

#### Wheels or Straps?

Everyone wants wheels, of course, but you’re generally better off without them. The main reason is that, other than airports, nowhere in the world has nice, perfectly flat, smooth surface which suitcase wheels work on. The other reason is that wheels add about 3kg to the weight of a bag. For almost all flights in the world you’ll have a checked baggage weight limit of 23kg. Hand luggage weight limits vary, but usually sit between 8-10kg. Generally 3kg wasted on wheels isn’t worth it, especially when you’ll barely ever get to use them. Backpacks offer a lot more flexibility. The choice is completely yours, I’m just saying, choose a backpack.

#### Top Loading vs Front Loading

There are two main types of backpack: Those which have a zip to open the entire front panel (front loading), and those which have a drawstring opening at the top with cover that clips down over it (top loading). Generally top loading bags last longer (zips are the first thing to break on almost all bags), however, they are a complete fucking nightmare to pack and unpack. Front loading backpacks have the advantage that you can actually get to your stuff without unpacking the entire bag. This is critical if you want to use the backpack as hang luggage, because you’ll need to be able to quickly and efficiently remove your laptop and wash bag at airport security. Preferably without your underwear exploding all over the x-ray machine as you viciously yank at something that feels like it might be your laptop in the depths of your bag.

#### Big vs Small

Whatever size bag you buy, you’re going to fill it. Somewhere, rooted deep inside your psyche, is a little voice saying “might as well fill that extra space up” - and it’s unavoidable. It’s much better to force yourself to fit everything into the absolute minimum size bag that you can, rather than buying something bigger with “extra space if I need it” - because you’ll find out you use it even if you don’t need it.

I use an Osprey Farpoint 55 as my main bag. It used to be pretty hard to find in the UK, but they seem to be everywhere now and you shouldn’t have any trouble finding one online for around £90 ($140). I knew this was an important decision and I  spent a good month researching backpacks to make sure that I got the absolute best one for my needs. So what’s so good about this one?

First, it has all the standard stuff. It’s extremely well made, it can take a beating, the zips are high quality, and… you know… it’s a backpack. The Farpoint 55 is actually two bags: a main bag and a day pack which zips onto the outside. Having a day-pack is a must. Once you’ve settled into a new place you’ll probably want to explore, or take your laptop to a cafe to work, or carry your camera around all day, or any number of other things which you don’t want or need your main bag for. I use my day pack every single day (no pun intended). 

Some people moan that you should avoid backpacks as your day pack and opt instead for a shoulder bag. The main reason is to avoid pickpockets by having the opening to your back under your arm rather than behind you on your back where you can’t see it or feel it. It’s a valid concern, but for me the first and foremost concern is comfort. Backpacks are comfortable to walk around with all day. Shoulder bags, no matter what you do with them, are uncomfortable and even painful after you’ve been carrying all the weight on one shoulder for a few hours, with the bag bouncing off your leg at every step. I choose comfort for the 340 days a year that I’m nowhere near crowded areas and pickpockets. I put the bag on my front or slung under one arm from one strap on the 25 days a year that I am concerned about security.

I decided that I wanted something that would be hand-baggage size no matter what airline I travelled on. This means conforming to RyanAir’s 55cm x 40cm x 20cm hand luggage restriction, which they enforce rigorously. The Farpoint 55 comes in two sizes, Small and Medium (you get different sizes based on your height, to fit you best). While the “55” in “Farpoint 55” stands for 55 litres, the smaller of the two sizes is actually only 52 litres and, when the daypack is contained within the carefully packed main compartment rather than strapped to the outside… fits exactly into the bag-cages which airlines like RyanAir and easyJet use to check the size of your luggage.

The main compartment of the smaller version of the Farpoint has a volume of 37 litres, while the day pack has a volume of an additional 15 litres. If you want to go carry-on, you need to fit everything into that 37 litre compartment.

Another benefit of this bag is that when I’m packing for air travel, I pack very carefully and efficiently - minimising size. However when I’m travelling from place to place within a country and I don’t need to worry about the size of my bag, I can just throw everything haphazardly into the main compartment and zip the day pack onto the outside. This is a big plus, as packing efficiently enough to fit into air travel restrictions takes time and gets very old very quickly.

#### Backpack Strap Organisers

This is a very small thing, but very useful. I absolutely hate backpacks with straps dangling everywhere. You can almost estimate the number of sexually transmitted diseases a dirty student backpacker has by how many straps they have dangling off their bags. It’s not a good look. 
I solve this by using large velcro cable ties to tidy away my straps completely, and look a bit less like a tramp. The first few months, these little bastards fell off repeatedly, leaving me breathless and with straps-a-danglin’ every time I had to hurry to an airport. I solved that by developing the now-patented O’Strap technique, which involves rolling the cable ties into the straps themselves. It’s hard to explain with words, so I made a video that shows how it’s done if you want to get rid of those pesky straps on your bag.

Oh, and I completely removed the waist straps on the daypack of the Farpoint 55. Those things are pointless.

### Clothes

This is a big section, so I’ll break it down into smaller sub-categories. As I mentioned, when I first left the UK there were some Crocodile Dundee resemblances that were rather unfortunate, right down to the cowboy hat (minus the corks, I should note) which my friends Paul and Chris took a great deal of pleasure in berating me for - whilst taking photos and laughing manically, obviously. I invested a lot of money in ultra lightweight tshirts and boxer shorts with special breathable material that dries really quickly when washed. I bought classic convertible travel trousers with zip-off legs that turned them into shorts. I picked up a pair of extremely comfortable Merell hiking shoes which I could quite comfortably have scaled Everest in. I even had a pair of Teva sandals for hot weather, with sexy velcro straps. Overall - I looked like a twat.

I realised, after the first few months, that when you own so little - things like clothes (which never mattered much to me before) start to really matter. If I was going on a month long hiking trip and camping every night then I would probably by all that hyper-efficient travel stuff again… but I’m not. I’m just living my normal life, in different places. And that calls for normal clothes.

#### Shirts

I carry roughly 5 T-shirts, 2 vests and 1 shirt with me at any point in time. You don’t need a lot of any type of clothes, because you wash them just like you would at home. If you think about it, you probably wear mainly the same items of clothing which are your favourites anyway - it’s really not that different. This is the item of clothing that fluctuates most within my bag because, quite simply, they wear out. I buy about 1 T-shirt a month, and throw away about 1 T-shirt a month - so there’s rarely time for me to get sick of them. Vests are particularly handy in very hot climates or beach locations, as well as in colder climates, when you can wear them under a T-shirt to double up. The one standard shirt comes in handy whenever I’m going out to a restaurant in the evening and want to look a little bit more formal

#### Fleece / Jumper

It’s a good idea to have one warm layer of clothing no matter where you’re going. It gets cold at night in many places, planes are almost always freezing, and some forms of transport (particularly in Asia) are extreme with their love of air conditioning. I opt for a SCOTTEVEST Fleece 5.0 in this department, which is a unique and clever item of clothing which I can’t recommend highly enough. This is one area where my travel geekery knows no bounds. From the outside, the Fleece 5.0 looks like a normal fleece. On the inside, you’ll find 24 different pockets which can hold practically everything you own. This thing isn’t just great for keeping me warm at different levels depending on the temperature (the front unzips and the sleeves zip-off), but it gets me through airport security with unprecedented ease. I empty my pockets of absolutely everything, and put them in the fleece instead. It has special compartments for passport/boarding pass, tablet, smart phone, water bottle, keys, the lot. So when I rock up to an x-ray machine I simply remove the fleece, place it in a tray, and walk straight through the metal detector without any messing around (Pro tip: carbon fibre belt buckle). I wear the fleece when travelling on planes, so it doesn’t take up any space at all in my bag. 

Because it has so many pockets + a “weight management system”, if I have to travel on an airline with strict hand-luggage weight limits then I can quickly and easily offload the heaviest items from my bag into the fleece - increasing the weight of my body (which they can’t do anything about) whilst decreasing the weight of my bag. I can’t recommend this thing highly enough.

I wasn’t originally particularly sold on the whole concept. A vest with loads of pockets - great. Now, however, I refer to anyone who doesn’t travel with a SCOTTEVEST as “completely crazy” - which is a technical term. Now that I have one, I just don’t know how I ever managed without one - it comes in handy in all sorts of unexpected situations. I was writing part of this book on a 5 hour easyJet flight from The UK to Egypt and decided to purchase a very large 1 litre bottle of duty free Vodka while on board (Spirits are expensive in Egypt, and the quality is low. If you ever want to experience a real hangover, just have some Egyptian Vodka.) I learned, after having completed the payment of course, that easyJet have a new “green initiative” which basically means “no bags”. Great. The prospect of walking through Egyptian immigration with a backpack and a huge bottle of Vodka in one hand wasn’t overly appealing. Then I remembered that I was wearing my SCOTTEVEST. Wouldn’t you know it, the bottle didn’t just fit perfectly into one of the huge interior pockets - it was completely invisible from the outside, with no obvious bulk.

#### Trousers / Skirts

I started out with convertible zip-off things, as I mentioned, because the ENTIRE INTERNET says “whatever you do, don’t take jeans” because they’re heavy, bulky, they dry incredibly slowly, and make it obvious that you’re a westerner. Ignore this. I have jeans, and it’s fine. Frankly, I’d rather look like an average westerner than Crocodile Dundee. I wear the jeans when I travel, so they don’t take up any space in my bag. I wash them and dry them as normal, because I’m not travelling every day - it’s not a big deal. I only have 1 pair, however, it’s easily sufficient. Women have the option of skirts and leggings in this department in addition to jeans, both of which can be fairly compact to pack.

#### Shorts / Swim Wear

If you’re expecting to go to hot climates, you’ll need some swimwear and you’ll want some shorts. For guys, one pair of comfortable shorts and one pair of board shorts is the best way to go. If you don’t expect to swim much, you can just get shorts and use them for swimming if you ever need to. If you expect to swim loads (like me, kiteboarding) then you can get a couple of pairs of board shorts and also wear them as shorts. For women, most tourist destinations around the world are pretty liberal when it comes to bathing attire, however if you’re planning to go to some more remote places then you may find local cultures to be a little more modest. Female travellers generally advise that if it’s something sensible (2 pieces isn’t an issue) that you’d be comfortable wearing in front of your parents, then you’re probably fine.

#### Underwear

Guys, 4-5 pairs of boxers is fine. You’re going to be doing washing, remember? Don’t bother with extreme “base-layer” super anti-moisture wicking fast-dry boxers which cost about £25 ($40) each. I tried those, they weren’t particularly amazing and they fell apart after 6 months. As with the shirts, no matter what you buy will be washed regularly, and wear out after a while. Expect to buy replacements every 4-6 months. Women generally have underwear which is much smaller in size, so can easily pack more pairs as well as a couple of bras. Female travellers recommend that also having a sports bra can often be useful.  For everyone, it’s really not worth taking anything that’s white.

#### Socks

I travel with 4 pairs, and this is just about the one area where I condone spending money on technical fabrics. Normal socks will make your feet overheat in hot climates, and they will also fall apart very quickly. I use the “Hot and Temperate” socks from Rohan (in the UK), but you can find similar things from a variety of retailers. Look for very durable and breathable material. I bought almost all my clothes from Rohan before I departed, the socks were the only thing I had left after 6 months. If you get a good pair, and you travel to a lot of hot places (where you’re wearing flip-flops and don’t need socks) then a few good pairs of socks will last a very long time.

#### Footwear

I travel with one pair of DC trainers, and one pair of knock-off Nike flip-flops. Again, I’m not a backpacker, I’m not walking across a continent, so full-on hiking shoes and sandals were just overkill. My trainers are really comfortable and I can walk all day in them with no problems. They’re not sports trainers, so they can pass for semi-formal when required - and if I ever do any proper hiking then I rent or borrow a proper pair of hiking books anyway. Sandals will generally make you stick out like a sore thumb when you’re [absolutely fucking anywhere], whereas flip-flops are perfectly comfortable for day to day use in hot climates. I put them right at the very bottom of my bag and they take up virtually no space. They also make a convenient hard bottom to my bag to support the weight above, and mean that I can dump the bag on the ground without worrying about knocking anything.

### Packing Cubes

Once you’ve got all your clothes ready to go in your bag, one very handy thing to have available is a simple set of packing cubes. You put your clothes in the cubes, then arrange the cubes in the bag. It just makes everything more organised, and it makes it much easier to consistently pack everything into the same size and the same place within your bag. I got a set of 3 packing cubes from amazon. I put all my shirts in one, all my shorts/swimwear/underwear in another, and my flip-flops in the last.

### Micro-fibre Travel Towel

Having your own towel is always handy. You’ll find that sometimes you go two months without using it once, and other times (particularly around beach locations) you end up using it every single day. Micro-fibre towels are tiny, weigh nothing, dry fast, and are super-absorbent. The material feels a bit weird to dry yourself with, but it’s worth it. If you have short hair, get a small one - you really don’t need much to dry yourself completely. If you have long hair, get a larger one to absorb the extra moisture.

### Accessories: Hat + Sunglasses + Watch

Get a hat. It doesn’t matter what kind, get one that you like, but just make sure you get one. Whenever you’re in a hot climate the sun poses a very real risk to your skin, and your face is one of the most sensitive areas to UV radiation. Yes, radiation. Get a hat. 

Get some sunglasses. Not expensive ones. You will lose them, you will sit on them, you will scratch them and bend them. The question is not “if” it’s “when” - and it will most likely be sooner rather than later. Find some which look nice, but aren’t a major brand, and wouldn’t make you cry if you lost them. 

Get a watch. It really sucks not knowing the time or date when travelling and your iPhone has run out of battery or is buried at the bottom of your bag somewhere. Optional bonus: get one which can display a 2nd timezone - I have my secondary timezone always set to the UK, where most of my clients are.

### A First Aid Kit

You’ll use it rarely, but when you need it you’ll be glad you have it. I got a small kit off Amazon and adjusted the contents slightly, removing the nail scissors for flying, and adding Ibuprofen, Paracetamol, and Imodium instants. Paracetamol is obviously needed for hangovers, which you will have. Ibuprofen is great for muscle pain, or treating hangovers when you’ve run out of Paracetamol. What’s Imodium? I’m so glad you asked. It’s anti-diarrhoea medication, which is a subject that no one likes to talk about - but is fairly important nonetheless. I don’t have a delicate stomach, I never have done, however - when travelling you will suffer from this, no matter where you go. Your digestive system often just can’t handle such a large change in the type of things you’re feeding it with, particularly water. I didn’t think I’d need these little tablets at all, I bought them “just in case” - but I’m very glad I did. One of those babies down the hatch and you don’t shit for a week. It’s awesome.

Also, make sure you stick some good plasters (the really sticky kind) in your first aid kit. You’re going to get blisters at some point, and plasters can be hard to find and very expensive in developing countries. 

### Wash Bag

Get a good wash-bag that can hold all of your toiletries. Remember that any fluids or creams which you have may not exceed 100ml in volume, and all of the must fit together into a standard-sized airport zip-lock bag (Pro tip: whenever you’re at an airport and you see these bags being given away for free, grab 5. Many airports make you pay for them so it’s good to save some for later). I also picked up my own set of travel bottles so that I can carry a small quantity of cologne, shampoo, and shower gel in lightweight plastic bottles. It’s very hard to find “travel sized” stuff, so I find it’s better to have these re-usable bottles and just top them up whenever I can. I also have some very specific recommendations in this department which I’ll go into a little more detail with:

### Odabahn

I discovered Odabahn completely by accident. I was searching for non-aerosol deodorant on Amazon (I don’t know why on Amazon, I was on an Amazon shopping spree) and the firs thing that popped up, with a bajillion 5 star reviews, was a little bottle of stuff called “Odabahn”. For just £8 ($13) you can purchase a 75ml spray bottle of a liquid which you spray on areas which you don’t want to sweat once a week, and then they don’t sweat. To mine, and apparently every-Amazon-customer-ever’s amazement, the stuff actually works! I still carry normal deodorant as well, for the sake of smelling good, but in hot climates in particular Odabahn removes annoying wet patches and makes your clothes last longer.

### Lip Balm

One of my absolute do-not-travel without items is, bizarrely enough, lip balm. I picked some up on a whim on the way to the airport when I was first leaving for Australia and I’ve been absolutely amazed at how often I’ve needed it. Travelling between multiple climates, either natural or artificial (planes), plays havoc with your skin, the lips especially. Having a small lip balm thingy close to hand is very nice indeed. Mine is coco-butter flavoured. Oh yes.

### Ear Plugs

Occasionally you’ll end up in noisy places and want some peace and quiet. Ear plugs weigh nothing and take up no space, so throw a few pairs in your wash bag and you’ll be glad when you do need them. It needn’t just be for sleeping, ear plugs also come in handy for rock concerts, motor races, and screaming children on planes. 

### Universal Sink Plug

The way to make a small number of clothes work for long-term travel is to wash them. Most of the time I’m in an apartment with a washing machine, but every so often I’ll be somewhere without one. I either find a local laundrette, or the fall back plan is to simply hand-wash clothes in the sink. Not all sinks have plugs, so a universal sink plug solves that problem.

### Space Pen

There are lots of points when you need a pen throughout your travels, especially with immigration and landing cards at various airports around the world. You don’t need a Space Pen, particularly… I just like them. 

## Stuff People Tell You to Buy That You Don’t Need

I bought most of these things and then threw them away again after not using them, at all, for anything, ever. I’m not saying don’t buy them at all, if you think you need one of these items, then get it. But if you’re not sure whether or not to buy one of these, I’d recommend against it.

Laptop sleeve/case - use your day pack for this, extra case/skin just adds too much bulk and is largely unnecessary. See other case notes below.

Washing line - only really needed in hostels, I’ve never been short on clean/convenient places to hang washing.

Spork - really, if you’re not hiking through the jungle, you’re not going to struggle to find cutlery.

Swiss army knife - you’re never getting on a plane with one anyway, plus it’s heavy and over the top.

Water bottle - you don’t need a special water bottle, just buy a bottle of mineral water wherever you are.

Umbrella - buy one locally if you’re in a wet place, they’re not expensive, no point dragging one round the world with you.

Pacsafe Mesh - it’s a massive wire mesh to go around your bag, weighs a ton, I’ve never found need for one yet.

Head lamp / flashlight - your phone has a flashlight when you need it, which is rarely.

Mosquito net - not unless you’re going to sub-Saharan Africa, excluding South Africa.

Mosquito repellant - buy it when you get there, the plugs are generally better than the sprays.

Padlocks - if you’re going to check your bag (don’t) then yes. Otherwise no, they’re very heavy, and not that useful.

Special wallet - looks stupid and doesn’t really offer any added security. They’re old hat.

Money belt - even worse than special wallet.

Document holder - takes up unnecessary space to hold your passport and boarding pass. Use a SCOTTEVEST instead.

Spare pair of glasses - losing them is generally unlikely, better to just carry a copy of your prescription unless you’re totally blind without them.

Playing cards - you’ll never use them, ever, unless you’re drunk, and then you’ll lose them. Easy enough to buy on the road, too.

Youth discount cards - they’re almost all pointless. Only get one if it’s for a specific reason, not just one that works “at lots of places”.

Travel pillows - waste of space and, again, you’ll mainly be in one place at a time, not on the road.

Water purifiers - you can generally buy bottled water easily and cheaply in countries where the tap water is not suitable for drinking.

If there are other things not on this list which you’re not sure about then there’s a very simple two-question test which can help you make a decision. First, how often will you use it? If the answer is less than once a month, don’t buy it. Second, can you buy it when you get there? If the answer is yes, don’t buy it. It’s the little things that really add up and make the difference, so you have to be pretty strict with yourself.

## Electronics / Work Gear

Once you’ve got all of your basic travel gear in place, it’s time to think about all the electronics and gear you’re going to need to carry on working effectively around the world. Again, this will vary based on your exact working requirements, so I’ll just do my best to give you an idea of what I use as a travelling web designer / photographer.

### The Laptop

For pretty much everyone, this is the most important piece of equipment you’ll have with you. My preference here is a 13” Apple Macbook Air. The Macbook Air range is absolutely perfect for travel - for obvious reasons. A lot of people have asked me if Macbook Air is “enough” to be your main and only machine, the answer to which is a resounding “good God yes”. My Air is the most powerful Mac I’ve ever owned. I sold an iMac, a Mac Mini and a Macbook Pro when I left the UK and replaced them with the Air - which easily out-performs all of them.

The only situation I would advise that a Macbook Air isn’t powerful enough, is with video editing. I started doing a lot of HD video work about half way through my first year of travel and while the Air can handle it… it’s slow to render. If you’re a video producer, you should probably shell out for a Retina spec Macbook Pro or higher. 

For anyone who doesn’t do design or video work, I’d highly recommend the 11” Macbook Air. It’s actually the computer I wish I had, the size is absolutely perfect for travel, and it packs a mighty punch inside that tiny shell. The only reason I have the 13” is because it has a slightly higher resolution which is really needed for extensive work with Photoshop or Final Cut Pro. My work these days, however, is increasingly moving towards less design work and more business management and writing. I will switch to the smaller size as soon as I’m able to. I’m writing this very paragraph, for example, on a 3 hour train from Bournemouth to Coventry. With the 13” - this is a pretty cramped experience, it’s not fun and there’s only so much I can get done squeezing the laptop between me and the seat in front before I’ll have to take a break. With the 11” - I would be completely comfortable, and could work without issue. The same applies to planes.

I also carry the following accessories for the Macbook Air:

Seethru Satin Case - This is a really important piece of kit. The Seethru Satin Case doesn’t just protect my Mac from damage, it serves another purpose. It makes my Mac look like a Dell. I know it’s counter-intuitive to spend a lot of money on a computer which is beautiful and then hide it, but when you’re in developing countries you want to blend in. People will spot a guy on a shiny chrome Macbook a mile off, the big glowing Apple on the back screams “mug the shit out of me, I can afford a new one anyway”. Another black computer covered in stickers is a little less obvious. You can also remove the case whenever you’re staying somewhere for a while - which I frequently do.

One note here, the particular case which I got - the Seethru Satin - completely sucks. Before I bought it there were reviews on Amazon about how they break easily, but I couldn’t find any alternatives so I bought one anyway. It broke within 2 weeks. Luckily I had time to get a new one before I left the country (Amazon replaced it for free), and this one lasted for a whole 2 months before the little clips started snapping off. It still works, it just comes loose very easily. Not recommended. See if you can find something which looks like it’ll last a little better.

I also use a piece of software called “Hidden App” which sits on my Macbook completely out of sight. If the computer is ever stolen, I can simply log into a web service and report it as stolen. As soon as the device next connects to the internet it will automatically start photographing the thief with the webcam, tracking its own location, and wipe itself remotely - if you have asked it to do so. I’ve never had to use it, but it’s nice to know it’s there.

VGA Display Adaptor - This allows me to plug into projectors whenever I’m speaking at events, or plug into external monitors for a little extra space whenever I happen to come across one in a place I’m staying.

Ethernet Adaptor - This is a must-have for me. You’ll find that a great deal of places around the world (including luxury hotels, not just cheap places) have broadband internet via ethernet cable, but no wifi. Or the wifi just plain doesn’t work. It’s tiny, so it’s not a big deal to take along as a backup.

Nifty Minidrive - At the time of writing, I just ordered one of these from Kickstarter. It won’t be manufactured or delivered for a few months yet, so I can’t write a review, however it’s well worth checking out. The Nifty Minidrive is an adaptor which will take a Micro-SD card and slot into the standard SD card slot on a Macbook Pro or Macbook Air, sitting flush with the computer. What’s the point? Well I have a 256GB Solid State Drive and with one of these things I can get another 64gb of storage into it with no extra weight or inconvenience. 

### External Hard Drive

I carry a Western Digital MyPassport 1TB (soon to upgrade to 2TB) external hard drive everywhere with me. Half of this is dedicated to a time-machine backup of my entire Macbook Air, the other half is for offloading media to which I don’t have an immediate need for - mainly large video and photo library archives. The Lacie Rugged drives are quite popular for travelling photographers, but they’re frequently unreliable in my experience. I prefer the Western Digital, encased in a Nintendo DS hard case.

I keep my external drive and my Macbook apart as much as I can. If I ever lose the Macbook, it’s fully insured. Getting the data back is the real problem. I don’t take my external drive with me in my daypack when I go out to work in a cafe. Just in case.

### Smart Phone + Battery Pack

Before I started travelling I debated getting rid of my iPhone and just using a cheap phone + my laptop, but I’m really glad I didn’t do that. My iPhone is probably my single most-used piece of travel equipment. It has all of my booking information, all my music, all my work (emails), and is my gateway to the outside world when I don’t have the time or inclination to get out my laptop - which is often. It’s also great as a compact camera.

I’ve added a super cheap external battery case to my iPhone which serves several purposes. First, it gives me about 3 days of extra battery life on average, or about 1 extra day during heavy use. This is absolutely priceless when you’re on a long journey and don’t have the opportunity to charge your phone. Second, it does the same thing as the Seethru Satin Case for my Macbook Air - it says “mug me” a little less by making the phone bigger, bulkier, and generally ugly. Third, it protects my phone when I drop it. This is also on my must-have list.

### Universal Sim Card

Most of the time, the easiest way to get your phone working in a new place is to pick up a pre-paid sim card as soon as you arrive at the airport. Almost every airport sells these right outside the sliding door that leads you to the arrivals hall. When you arrive somewhere with no sim-cards in sight, however, or you’re simply staying for a short enough time to not make it worth buying a sim card - you need a fall back plan. 

There are quite a lot of companies doing universal sim cards these days, and all of them work in roughly the same way. You get a sim card, you put it in your phone, and it works in around 170 countries right off the bat. It’s free to receive calls, and what’s more - it only costs people who are calling you from anywhere in the world the equivalent of a local rate. Some of them have some minutes and data included, others don’t. My preference is for the *** sim card pack from STA Travel, which does the job nicely, and is extremely cheap.

### Mifi Device

In some countries you’ll find that the only way of getting online is via 3G. This isn’t the end of the world, the speeds are generally between 1-3mbps and very usable - but they almost always come in the form of a data sim card which goes in a USB dongle thing. These USB things are annoying, and waste one of your limited and valuable USB ports whenever you want to be online. A Mifi device is a portable wireless router that solves this problem. Insert your data sim card into the Mifi and it broadcasts a standard wifi signal which you can connect up to 5 devices to. 

Make sure, however, that the sim card will work in the Mifi whenever you’re buying a new one in a new place. Take the Mifi to the shop with you and test it while you’re there. Some sim cards require proprietary software to connect to their networks, loaded onto one of the aforementioned 3G dongles. So it’s worth checking before you end up at home only to discover you have to turn around and go back again.

### Good Earphones

First, throw away the white earbuds - again, they scream “mug me”. Second, you’re going to be spending a lot of time on planes, trains, and buses - trust me you’re going to want to block out noise whenever you need to get some work done. I also found that I started listening to a great deal more music when I started travelling just because music is something I can buy that doesn’t add any weight to my bag.

My recommendation here is the Sennheiser MM70 (i version for iPhone or S version for everyone else) - which are awesome. They double as a headset, so you can still take/make calls and control your music - and the sound quality is unbelievably good. If you’ve only used the Apple earbuds up until now, these will surprise you a great deal. 

If you’re a total audiophile and feel that you need full headphones rather than earbuds, make sure you get some that fold down to a relatively compact size for travel. Either way, I’d recommend getting the Sennheiser MM70 series first and seeing how you get on / how much you end up using them while you’re on the road. They’re infinitely more convenient for travel, and the sound is really good.

### Amazon Kindle

My Kindle is, without doubt, my favourite gadget that I’ve bought in the last few years. Before I stared travelling I had both an iPad and a Kindle so I had to choose what to take with me. I got rid of the iPad - it wasn’t even a hard decision. What you have to understand about a Kindle, if you’ve never used one before, is that it’s good at one thing - books. It’s not a tablet, it’s not multifunctional, it won’t do everything an iPad can do, but it does books - and it does them really well. I haven’t been a great reader over the last few years, but whilst travelling (even before this long trip) I always find myself looking for something to do whilst I’m waiting for my next plane/train/bus/taxi/whatever. Phone and laptop batteries disappear pretty quick, and are easy to get sick of. The Kindle is amazing to travel with - beautifully filling the gaps whenever you have some spare time. And reading is good for you. Fact.

I have the wifi only version - it works really well. 

### Universal Power Adaptor

With all these electronics you’re going to want to plug them in to charge pretty regularly, and you want them to be able to do that wherever you go. One or two power adaptors (I would suggest 2 if you have a lot of camera gear, otherwise 1 is enough) will make sure that you can plug in no matter where you are. Even better if you can find one which has both a standard plug socket and a USB socket which can be used simultaneously. All USB devices charge much faster when plugged into the mains vs into a USB port on your computer.

### Cables + Misc Accessories

I carry a pencil case which holds all my random electronics stuff. It has a spare iPhone cable, spare camera cable, both my HSBC internet banking security devices (which I hate), a sharpie, more velcro cable ties, camera batteries and memory cards, my display and ethernet adaptors, and my Mifi device. Anything small that I don’t want to lose goes in this pencil case.

### Camera Gear

Whether you’re a professional photographer or just someone who wants to record some of their travels as a memento, choosing the right camera gear is an important issue. I’ve changed my entire gear lineup 3 times since I started travelling, I’m extremely good at getting this wrong. Here’s some advice based on my experience so far.

If your only interest in photography is to capture your travels for yourself and for your Facebook wall: use your smart phone. These days smart phones as-well-as and often better than low end compact digital cameras. If you spend a little time learning how to use it properly, you can take great photos on a modern smart phone and not need to add any weight at all to your bag.

If you have an active interest in photography or a background as a professional photographer, but photography is not a crucial source of your income: get a Fujifilm X100. I’ll let you go and look at the reviews yourself, I will simply add that this is the best camera I’ve ever owned and will get to around 90% of the quality of a full DSLR rig.

If you are a professional photographer or videographer: obviously you already have a complete set up which you’re going to use regardless of what I say. Weight is your biggest enemy, and it’s very hard to keep under control with photography gear. I travel with one body, two lenses (wide angle and a fifty), a Gorrillapod Focus (doubles as basic Steadicam), a few filters, and an LCD viewfinder. Neoprene pouches are light, compact, and will protect lenses and body in your bag while adding minimal bulk. Make sure you have spare batteries and memory cards for situations where you don’t have much downtime to refresh everything. Resist GPS hot-shoe mounts, flash units, external battery grips, full size tripods and large zoom lenses wherever possible.

## How to Pack

So how do we fit all that crap into a single carry-on sized bag? That’s the fun part, of course. My best piece of advice here is to come up with a packing system, and use it every single time you pack. Not only will this ensure that everything always fits into your bag the same way, but it’ll also make it harder for you to forget things when you’re leaving a place. Packing the same things over and over again into the same part of your bag will soon make it obvious if anything is missing from your routine. 

Your system, no matter what you do, will evolve over time - and that’s a good thing. You’ll get rid of some things, you’ll pick up other things, or you’ll just discover a slightly different way to arrange things that makes more sense. All of that is fine, so don’t worry about changing your packing system once you’ve got one, just try to keep the major structural elements as similar as possible.

You still won’t be protected, of course, from forgetting anything new that you buy which isn’t a part of your routine. This was how I managed, very cleverly, to leave an entire set of expensive new camera batteries and charger behind in Canada. So the routine isn’t foolproof, but it does help.

Here are some packing tips based on what I do. These are all pretty simple stuff, but it’s worth going over them just to give you an idea of where to start with your own system:

Put the heaviest things at the very bottom of your bag. I have my flipflops right at the bottom, to make a nice little platform, and after that all of my camera gear (body/lenses/charger/etc) and external hard drive goes right at the bottom. You’ll find it much easier to carry your bag when the bag has a low centre of gravity (which can be directly supported by the waist straps of your bag, if required).

Put the most delicate things at the very top of your bag. I have my pencil-case with small/breakable items and electronics right at the top of my bag. My sunglasses case also goes up here. Put anything which you don’t want to be squished too much right at the top to avoid pressure from other items within the bag.

Put the things you’re going to need to get out most regularly as close to the zips as possible. I only have to open a 30cm gap in my bag at airports to remove my washbag/liquids for security checks. I can also access my day pack with my laptop, kindle and earphones (basic stuff that I need all the time), which also need to come out for security checks. With any fluids, you’re going to need to fit them into a airline regulation size zip-lock bag. Make sure this bag is sealed. Occasionally changes in air pressure can cause fluid containers to leak, and you don’t want to unpack all your gear only to find that it’s now entirely drenched in shampoo.

Time yourself packing your bag from scratch. You’ll often find yourself trying to factor packing time into a rough calculation commonly referred to as “When the fuck do I have to leave for the airport?” - Having a an average number on how long it takes you to pack everything and get out the door is extremely helpful. If it’s longer than 20 minutes, however, you should review your packing system and try to make it a bit more efficient.

It’s also a good idea to construct a couple of different “modes” of packing. I have three: air travel, ground travel, and day-to-day. 
In air travel mode everything is packed down rigorously in packing cubes and arranged in an exact space-saving formation. I select specific clothes to wear (all my biggest clothes: fleece, jeans, shoes, etc) so that my bag can hold as little as possible. This takes a good 20 minutes, but when complete - my bag is carry-on sized and nimble. 
In ground travel mode I pack everything properly, but I don’t worry about selecting specific clothes so my fleece usually goes inside as well as my jeans and sometimes my shoes. My bag is pretty compact, the only difference is the that the day-pack gets attached to the outside. This is perfect for trains/buses, and takes me about 15 minutes to pack. 
In day-to-day mode, I pretty much just shove everything in my bag, not bothering with packing cubes or being particularly careful about where things go. My day pack gets attached to the outside, and no compression straps are used so the bag can expand to hold more. Packing like this only takes me 5 minutes, but my bag is big. If I just have a short journey (like changing hotel / apartment) this is the easiest option.

I’m able to do these 3 methods because I have a 52L bag which I pack down to 37L to fit on planes. So I have some extra space to play with when I need it.

Once you’ve packed everything for the first time, try experimenting with removing specific items to see how it affects the overall bulk of the bag. Sometimes removing relatively small things like a sunglasses case can open up a huge pocket of space that wasn’t there before. You’ll only find out what items in your pack are causing the bulk through trial and error - so get experimenting. 

### The Packing Test

Got everything and think you’re good to go? Excellent. Now to test it! Try packing absolutely everything that you’re going to be travelling with. No exceptions. Don’t leave out that laptop charger cause it’s inconvenient and won’t make much difference. Pack everything. Now go to Google Maps and pick a point 1 mile from your house. Don your bag and make sure you’re wearing everything you plan to travel in, too. Walk to the point which you selected with all your waist and chest straps undone - as soon as you get there, turn around and walk home. It should take you 20 to 30 minutes, without any breaks, and when you get back you shouldn’t be tired. It’s fine to have a little shoulder ache and have worked up a bit of a sweat, but you shouldn’t be out of breath. 

Why 2 miles, and why with straps undone? The distance is roughly the average of how far you should expect to have to walk without stopping with your bag when travelling. You can do 2 miles just around an airport, let alone from a train station to a hotel. As for the chest/waist straps, they’re fantastic when you have a chance to use them - but you’ll find that often you’ll be in situations where you need to put the bag on and off frequently, and you don’t get to use them most of the time. This is a good test to see how manageable your current gear load is. If you manage it easily, great. If you’re struggling by the end of the 2 miles, it’s time to remove something weighty. For me, that meant saying goodbye to my iPad - which was absolutely the right decision, in hindsight.
